2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1 and clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1 and clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1, clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1 (see constraint position 10 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1, clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1 (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell micro_core_v0_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) micro_core_v0_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell micro_core_v0_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) micro_core_v0_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1, clkfbout_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1, clk_out1_micro_core_v0_clk_wiz_1_1_1
Related violations: <none>
