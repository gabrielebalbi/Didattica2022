2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin micro_core_v0_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and sys_clk_pin (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and sys_clk_pin (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) micro_core_v0_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on UART_rxd relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on UART_txd relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led1 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
